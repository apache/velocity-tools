Known Issues/Bugs:
    - see bugzilla



Documentation:
   - Complete user guide.
   - Improve documention of any or all of the view tools and the 
     commons-logging/LogSystem bridges (either xml/dvsl or javadoc)
   - Create a developer's guide (how to write tools, tips on extending VVS, etc.)



Proposed Features/Upgrades:
    General:
        - convert project to use Maven
        - stop keeping jars in CVS
        
    VelocityView:
        - add a library of velocimacros for use with these tools
        - Pluggable toolbox manager in VelocityViewServlet
        - Tool pooling support (use commons-pool probably)
        - add chooseCharacterEncoding(req) to VVS to make dynamic encoding
          selection easier
        - look into supporting arbitrary layout depth (sort of a "tiles lite")
          for the VelocityLayoutServlet (cf. Niall's work with Simple)

    Generic tools:
        - add a library of general-use velocimacros
        - Template debugging tool(s)/support

    VelocityStruts:
        - add a library of velocimacros for use with struts tools
          (ideally these would be roughly parallel to struts tags to ease transition)
        - move dynamic javascript generation from java (ValidatorTool) to templates
          (this would probably work in concert with the velocimacro libraries)



Example Ideas:
   - a blank Velocity-Struts application as the starting point for development.
   - an application to demonstrate use of more obscure features like the 
     AbstractSearchTool, MultiViewsTool, IteratorTool, and the like.
   - Struts 1.1 example(s). Take the existing Struts 1.1 examples and replace 
     the view layer with Velocity. (show off Tiles, modules, Validator, etc.)
   - example app(s) to demonstrate the velocimacro libraries
   - self-documenting apps to explain and demonstrate key features
   - a FooShop-type demo app (i.e. something closer to real-world use)
