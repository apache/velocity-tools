index.explanation = This is a demo application meant to showcase the abilities of \
the various tools provided by the VelocityTools library, as well \
as some best practices for using them with the VelocityView servlets.
index.start = To begin, choose a tool from the menu.
index.asterisk = With the exception of the way we abuse the RenderTool and \
Velocimacros. They've been stretched pretty far in order to allow the content \
to be very rapidly developed and more user-interactive than is usually needed. \
This has entailed the loss of some performance and much clarity.  As such, the \
way we use these two facilities should probably not be considered a best practice. :)
