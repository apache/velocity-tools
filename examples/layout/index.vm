I'm a Velocity template using a layout file!
<P>


#if( !$layout )
<H3>Example Layouts</H3>
<A HREF="$link.setLayout('Printable.vm')">Printable layout</A>: same as adding &quot;?layout=Printable.vm&quot; to the URL
<BR>
<A HREF="$link.setLayout('TableBased.vm')">Table based layout</A>: same as adding &quot;?layout=TableBased.vm&quot; to the URL
<BR>
<A HREF="$link.setLayout('CSS.vm')">CSS based layout</A>: same as adding &quot;?layout=CSS.vm&quot; to the URL

#title( "Default" )

#else

#if( $layout == "CSS.vm" )
 #title( "CSS 3 Column" )
#elseif( $layout == "TableBased.vm" )
 #title( "Table Based" )
#elseif( $layout == "Printable.vm" )
 #title( "Printable" )
#end

<P>
<B>Currently using: $page_title layout </B><BR>
Notice how the web page title (\$page_title) is set from within the main content, but displayed by the layout in the web page "title".</P>



<B>Return to <A HREF="$link.setRelative('index.vm')">Default layout</A></B>

#end
</P>
